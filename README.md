#### OpenXstim: Open source programmable electrical stimulator

Transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSES), a non-invasive, spinal cord neuromodulation method holds tremendous promise and hope for the people with paralysis resultant of spinal cord injury (SCI) and other neurological conditions. Yet, there are not many options of such stimulation devices compared to other successful electrical stimulators, especially for most people with neurological injuries in the developing world. 

Hence, we have developed an open source programmable transcutaneous electrical stimulator (TES) to facilitate researchers to develop successful stimulation therapy for people with neurological conditions. Commonly available electronic components are being used in the stimulator so that it can be developed in places where availability is an issue. Total components cost is around $200!
