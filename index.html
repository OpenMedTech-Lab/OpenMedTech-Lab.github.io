            <p>Non-invasive Electrical Stimulation (ES) is a classic method to artificially activate the nerve or muscle fibres, especially after neurological injury or chronic conditions to engage them in activities which otherwise are not possible. The objective of this project was to develop a programmable electrical stimulator to allow researchers to develop successful stimulation therapies to restore functions in people with neurological injuries or conditions.

            <img src="https://openmedtech-lab.github.io/images/OpenXwheel.png" alt="OpenXwheel">
            <p>Regular standing after paralysing injury is very essential for healthy living. A number of secondary complications among the wheelchair users can be prevented just by regular standing. The objective of the project was to design a low-cost open source standing wheelchair for people with paralysis.</p>
