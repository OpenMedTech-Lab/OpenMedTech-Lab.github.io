            <img src="https://openmedtech-lab.github.io/images/OpenXstim.png" alt="OpeXstim">
            <p>Transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSES), a non-invasive, spinal cord neuromodulation method holds tremendous promise and hope for the people with paralysis resultant of spinal cord injury (SCI) and other neurological conditions. Yet, there are not many options of such stimulation devices compared to other successful electrical stimulators, especially for most people with neurological injuries in the developing world.</p>
            <p>Hence, we have developed an open source programmable transcutaneous electrical stimulator (TES) to facilitate researchers to develop successful stimulation therapy for people with neurological conditions. Commonly available electronic components are being used in the stimulator so that it can be developed in places where availability is an issue. Total components cost is around $200!

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/OpenMedTech-Lab/OpenXwheel">OpenXwheel:</a> Open source standing wheelchair</h3>
            <img src="https://openmedtech-lab.github.io/images/OpenXwheel.png" alt="OpenXwheel">
            <p>Regular standing using assistive device after paralysing spinal cord injury (SCI) has numerous benefits including improved cardiovascular health, increased muscle mass and bone strength, and avoiding life threatening conditions such as pressure ulcer. It also significantly improves self-esteem and psychological health. Current standing wheelchairs, however, are too expensive for most SCI individuals. Hence, we have developed a low-cost open-source standing wheelchair to improve the life of people with paraplegia in low- and middle-income settings.</p>
            <p>Hence, we have developed an open source standing wheelchair to improve the life of people with paralysis in low- and middle-income (LMI) settings. Careful considerations were given to simplify the design to avoid complex manufacturing process. It costs only around $166 in a LMI country to develop this standing wheelchair!

            <h3>OpenXwalk: Open source exoskeleton walker</h3>
            <img src="https://openmedtech-lab.github.io/images/OpenXwalk.jpg" alt="OpenXwalk">
            <p>Children facing movement challenges due to conditions like cerebral palsy often encounter difficulties with walking and may experience feelings of exclusion. Exoskeleton walkers offer a potential solution by providing support for walking and aiding muscle movements. These devices are customizable for each child, potentially contributing to both physical improvement and cognitive development. Beyond the physical benefits, exoskeletons can enhance social interactions, fostering a sense of inclusion and happiness. Early intervention with these walkers may lead to improved long-term outcomes. However, the availability of such walkers is limited, and their cost is high.</p>
            <p>Hence, we've developed an open-source exoskeleton walker, aiming to make this technology accessible to children worldwide, promoting their well-being and ensuring they can enjoy life like everyone else!
